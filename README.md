# CarX-Street-Cars-Glitch
There is a glitch in CarX Street that allows players to get unlimited cars. To do this, you need to follow these steps:

Go to the Car Dealership.
Select the car that you want to glitch.
Press the "Buy" button.
As soon as the purchase is confirmed, close the game.
Reopen the game and the car will be in your garage.
This glitch can be used to get any car in the game, including the most expensive ones. However, it is important to note that this glitch is likely to be patched by the developers in the future.

Here are some additional tips for using this glitch:

Only do this glitch with cars that you actually want to keep. If you buy a car that you don't like, you won't be able to sell it back.
Be careful not to buy too many cars at once. If you buy too many cars, your game may crash.
If your game does crash, try restarting your device.

Working fine for me till today 5/15/23. If its does not work in official version you can try with <a href="https://carxstreetapk.com">carx street unlimited money version</a>.
